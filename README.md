# Data Analysis in R
 Course work: Introduction to Data Analysis in R (beginner level), workshop taught at the  University of TÃ¼bingen (winter term 2021/22). 
 The course covered four full days and covered the following topics:

Block 1 (October 2021):
- Intro to R and R Studio: Getting familiar with the interface and first data types and operations
- Loading data frames and getting familiar with them
- Data manipulation with dplyr
- Plotting graphs with ggplot2:
  histograms,
  barplots,
  scatterplots,
  linegraphs

Block 2 (November 2021, still work in progress):
- Overview on linear regressions
- Presenting data with RMarkdown
- Final day: Group data analysis project day

The folder for both blocks contain: my slides, the project tasks the students had to finish in the interactive group work sessions, and the scripts for the respective
topics that are to be understood as hands-on coding material
